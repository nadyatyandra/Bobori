# Bobori
“Bobori” was obtained from "Bobo Sendiri", which can be translated as "Sleep Alone" in English. This application aims to help parents with tracking and implementing their baby’s sleep training using chair method. The parents need to fill in a daily form about their child's sleep training progress (baby's bedtime and distance between the baby and the parents).

## Why?
First-time mothers need to take care of their baby 24/7 even while they are asleep, depriving any semblance of parents' personal time. Sleeping is a basic need for all of us, including babies who need to be trained to sleep independently, however, this training requires time and effort from the parents.

Sleep training allows baby to learn to self-soothe and settle to sleep independently. So, the baby can sleep alone in their room without any crying and discomfort. In the chair method, parents need to sit in a chair beside the baby’s crib and gradually move farther until they are able to sit outside the room.

## Solution Concept
Creating an app that ***provides information and assistance*** for ***first-time mothers*** when ***the child is doing sleep training using Chair Method***, so ***the child could sleep on their own*** and ***the parents have more time for themselves***.
